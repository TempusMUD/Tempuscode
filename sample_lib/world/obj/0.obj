black rose~
The small rose is such a deep shade of red that it appears almost black.  
It feels warm in your hands, almost as if it was producing a heat of its own.
You notice a tiny stamp at the base of one of its petals. ~

The printing on the stamp appears to read:

scythe death~
It is a very heavy scythe.  The grey handle is made from hard wood and the
long iron blade is completely smooth from countless years of use.  It feels
cold to the touch.
