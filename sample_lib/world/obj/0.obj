load  of fresh hay.  A young farmer sits at the front of the wagon, holding
the reins of the two grey horses which pull the wagon.  To jump onto the
wagon,  type BOARD WAGON.

quad damage quake~
   The essence of magic has randomly converged here.  Glowing, pale blue
strands of flowing energy loop and swell to create an artifact of obvious
incalculable power.  The pale blue force forms an arc with pointed tips
which point upward.  A sharp spike of the same energy drives straight
downward through the arc and lies along the axis of the artifact's rotation.

You feel an irresistable urge to pick it up.

rift quantum flux~
Sparkling threads of the universal spacetime reality form a
small freestanding wall here. The threads, bits of quantum
probability waves, quiver and hum like the strings of a musical
instrument.  Bright motes of light drift off from the quasi-
substantial threads only to drift off and vanish in bursts, like
the explosions of tiny galaxies.  A flux in the wall of space,
just big enough for you to squeeze through, appears between
the quantum reality waves of spacetime.

scythe death~
It is a very heavy scythe.  The grey handle is made from hard wood and the
long iron blade is completely smooth from countless years of use.  It feels
cold to the touch.
